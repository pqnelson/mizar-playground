\section{Automorphisms}\label{sec:characteristic:automorphism}
Now, we have a section for defining inner and outer group
automorphisms. A \emph{group automorphism} is just a bijective endomorphism on
a group, and an \emph{endomorphism} is a group morphism whose codomain
is its domain.

Remember (\S\ref{par:characteristic:vocabularies}), although we are
defining new terms [[Endomorphism]] and [[Automorphism]], we do not need
to add them to our [[DICT/CHAR.VOC]] file. Why not? Because the tokens
are already included from \mml{mod4}.

\begin{definition}\index{Endomorphism|textbf}
Let $G$ be a group. An \define{Endomorphism} of $G$ is a group morphism
$f\colon G\to G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{def-remark}\index{$\End(G)$}
We denote the collection of endomorphisms of $G$ as $\End(G)$.
\end{def-remark}

\begin{def-remark}
Mizar uses the archaic word ``homomorphism'' instead of the more modern
conventional term ``morphism''. I will use the two interchangeably. And,
unless stated otherwise, it is understood these are group morphisms.

\begin{registration}\label{par:characteristic:register-bijective-for-endomorphism}
We begin by registering the attribute [[bijective]] for group
endomorphisms. This will effectively create a subtype of [[Endomorphism of G]],
the aptly named [[bijective Endomorphism of G]]. Most of our work has
been done in Theorem~\mml[Th38]{group6}\MizThm{GROUP\_6}{38}
(which effectively states the function on the underlying set
[[id (the carrier of G)]] is a multiplicative function and so nearly a
group morphism that we can reconsider it as an [[Endomorphism]]), and
the fact that [[id X]] is bijective.

\begin{definition}\index{Automorphism|textbf}\index{Endomorphism}
Let $G$ be a group. We define an \define{Automorphism} of $G$ to be a
bijective endomorphism $f\colon G\to G$. In particular, an inverse
$f^{-1}\colon G\to G$ exists and is a group morphism.
\end{definition}

We denote the collection of automorphisms of $G$ as $\Aut(G)$.

@ %def Automorphism

\begin{reserve}
  We will henceforth generically use $\varphi$ as an Automorphism of $G$
  unless otherwise stated. This means, for most theorems, we can omit
  explicitly stating, ``For any automorphism $\varphi$ of $G$, \dots'';
  and for most proofs, we can omit the line, ``Let $\varphi$ be an
  Automorphism of $G$''.

\begin{proposition}
For any automorphism $\varphi\colon G\to G$, its inverse $\varphi^{-1}$
is also an automorphism.
\end{proposition}

This is proven in Theorem~\mml[Th62]{group6}.\MizThm{GROUP\_6}{62} We have, for
example, the following accepted by Mizar:

\begin{mizar}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:characteristic:automorphism:trivial-subgroup-invariant-under-automorphisms}
For any group $G$ and endomorphism $f\in\End(G)$, we have the trivial
subgroup $\trivialSubgroup\subgroup G$ be preserved under $f$; i.e.,
$f(\trivialSubgroup)=\trivialSubgroup$.
\end{theorem}

The proof is simply ``follow your nose''.

\begin{proof}
\emph{Trivial}.

\begin{theorem}
For any automorphism $\varphi\in\Aut(G)$, we have $\varphi(\trivialSubgroup_{G})=\trivialSubgroup_{G}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof outline]
If $\phi$ is an automorphism of a group $G$, then
the image of the trivial subgroup under $\phi$ is a subgroup of itself
$\phi(\trivialSubgroup)\subgroup\trivialSubgroup$. We have, from
Theorem~\ref{thm:characteristic:automorphism:trivial-subgroup-invariant-under-automorphisms}, that $\phi(\trivialSubgroup)=\trivialSubgroup$ since
$\phi$ (being an automorphism) is also an endomorphism. And
Theorem~\mml[Th54]{group2}\MizThm{GROUP\_2}{54}
proves that $G$ is a subgroup of itself.
\end{proof}

$\trivialSubgroup_{G}\subgroup H$, and taken together, the result follows.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:characteristic:automorphism:restrict-automorphism-gives-monomorphism}
For any subgroup $H\subgroup G$ and automorphism $\varphi\in\Aut(G)$ of
$G$, we have $\varphi|_{H}\colon H\into\varphi(H)$ be an injective group morphism.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
Given a subgroup $H\subgroup G$ and automorphism $\varphi\in\Aut(G)$, we
know $\varphi|_{H}\colon H\to \varphi|_{H}(H)$ is a group morphism.
Since $\varphi$ is an automorphism, it is injective, and in particular
$\ker(\varphi)=\trivialSubgroup_{G}$. Then
$\ker(\varphi|_{H})\subgroup\ker(\varphi)$ and
$\trivialSubgroup_{G}\subgroup\ker(\varphi|_{H})$ implies
$\ker(\varphi|_H)$ is trivial, and thus $\varphi|_{H}$ is injective.
\end{proof}

  then Ker(phi|H) = (1).G by Lm2

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:characteristic:automorphism:f-fInv-H-is-subgroup-of-H}
Let $H\subgroup G$ be a subgroup such that
$\forall\varphi\in\Aut(G),\varphi(H)\subgroup H$.
Then any automorphism $\varphi$ of $G$ has an inverse which satisfies
$\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\subgroup\varphi(H)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\psi=\varphi^{-1}\in\Aut(G)$ be an automorphism (which follows from
Theorem~\mml[Th62]{group6}\MizThm{GROUP\_6}{62}). We have
$\psi(H)=\psi|_{H}(H)\subgroup H$ since the image of a morphism is a subgroup of
the codomain. Then $\phi(\psi(H))\subgroup\phi(H)$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:characteristic:automorphism:phi-phiInv-H-is-H}
  Let $G$ be a group, and $H\subgroup G$ be a subgroup.
  Then for any automorphism $\varphi\in\Aut(G)$, we have
  $\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]=H$.
\end{theorem}

This is an obvious result which is usually taken for granted.

\begin{proof}[Proof outline]
Let $\psi=\varphi^{-1}\in\Aut(G)$ (which follows from
Theorem~\mml[Th62]{group6}\MizThm{GROUP\_6}{62}). Then we establish any
group element $g$ is a member of $\varphi(\psi(H))$ if and only if $g$
is a member of $H$.
The result then follows that they are equal as groups using Theorem~\mml[Th60]{group2}\MizThm{GROUP\_2}{60}.

  for g being Element of G holds g in Image(phi|Image(psi|H)) iff g in H
  <<Proof: $\forall g\in G$, $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\iff g\in H$>>

end;
@ %def Th18

\begin{proof}[{Sub-proof ($\forall g\in G, g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\implies g\in H$)}.]
The bones of the proof for this claim amounts to unfolding the
logical structure of the claim.
\end{proof}

<<Proof: $\forall g\in G$, $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\iff g\in H$>>=
proof
  let g be Element of G;
  thus g in Image(phi|Image(psi|H)) implies g in H
  <<Step 1: $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\implies g\in H$>>

  thus g in H implies g in Image(phi|Image(psi|H))
  <<Step 2: $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\impliedby g\in H$>>
  thus thesis;
end;
@

\begin{proof}[{Proof step 1 ($g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\implies g\in H$)}.]
We begin by showing, if $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$, then there is
some [[M1:]] $a\in\varphi^{-1}(H)$ such that [[B2:]] $g=\varphi(a)$. And
then we have, by the same line of reasoning applied to $a$, there is
some [[M2:]] $b\in H$ such that [[B3:]] $\varphi^{-1}|_{H}(b)=a$. It
follows that $g = \varphi(\varphi^{-1}(b))$, and by Theorem~\ref{thm:characteristic:preparatory:f-finv-y-is-y} we have
$g = b$ which proves the claim.
\end{proof}

<<Step 1: $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\implies g\in H$>>=
proof
  assume g in Image(phi|Image(psi|H));
  <<$\exists a\in\varphi^{-1}(H),g=\varphi(a)$>>
  <<$\exists b\in H, a = \varphi^{-1}(b)$>>
  then b = phi.(psi.b) by Th6
        .= phi.((psi|H).b) by M2,Th2
        .= phi.a by B3
        .= g by B2;
  hence g in H;
end;
@

\begin{proof}[Proof sub-step 1]
Showing $a\in\varphi^{-1}(H)$ and $g=\varphi(a)$ follow from basic results.
\end{proof}

<<$\exists a\in\varphi^{-1}(H),g=\varphi(a)$>>=
then consider a being Element of Image(psi|H) such that
B1: g = (phi|Image(psi|H)).a by GROUP_6:45;
M1: a in Image(psi|H) & a is Element of G by GROUP_2:42;
then B2: phi.a = g by B1, Th2;
@

\begin{proof}[Proof sub-step 2]
Almost the same reasoning applies to $b\in H$ satisfying
$a=\varphi^{-1}(b)$.
\end{proof}

<<$\exists b\in H, a = \varphi^{-1}(b)$>>=
consider b being Element of H such that
B3: a = (psi|H).b
by M1,GROUP_6:45;
M2: b in H & b is Element of G by GROUP_2:42;
@

\begin{proof}[{Proof step 2 ($g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\impliedby g\in H$)}.]
To prove $g\in H$ implies $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$, we simply
let $K=\varphi^{-1}(H)$ and show $a = \varphi^{-1}|_{H}(g)\in K$ and
then show $b=\varphi|_{K}(a)\in\varphi[K]=\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$. Then
we have $b=\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(g))=g$ due to $\varphi$ being bijective.
The result follows.
\end{proof}

<<Step 2: $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]\impliedby g\in H$>>=
proof
  assume B1: g in H;
  set a = (psi|H).g;
  B2: a in Image(psi|H)
  <<Sub-step 1: $a\in\varphi^{-1}(H)$>>

  set K = Image(psi|H);
  set b = (phi|Image(psi|H)).a;

  B3: b in Image(phi|Image(psi|H))
  <<Sub-step 2: $b\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$>>
  thus g in Image(phi|K)
  <<Sub-step 3: $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$>>
end;
@

\begin{proof}[Proof sub-step 1 ($a\in\varphi^{-1}(H)$).]
The first step follows by unfolding definitions.
\end{proof}


<<Sub-step 1: $a\in\varphi^{-1}(H)$>>=
proof
  dom(psi|H) = the carrier of H by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  then g in dom(psi|H) by B1;
  then (psi|H).g in (psi|H) .: (the carrier of H) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
  then (psi|H).g in the carrier of Image(psi|H) by GROUP_6:def 10;
  then (psi|H).g in Image(psi|H);
  hence a in Image(psi|H);
end;
@

\begin{proof}[{Proof sub-step 2 ($b\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$)}.]
The next step, like the first, follows from definitions.
\end{proof}

<<Sub-step 2: $b\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$>>=
proof
  dom(phi|K) = the carrier of K by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  then a in dom(phi|K) by B2;
  then (phi|K).a in (phi|K) .: (the carrier of K) by FUNCT_1:def 6;
  then (phi|K).a in the carrier of Image(phi|K) by GROUP_6:def 10;
  then (phi|K).a in Image(phi|K);
  hence b in Image(phi|K);
end;
@

\begin{proof}[{Proof sub-step 3 ($g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$)}.]
The last step is a little more involved, because it requires
recalling $\varphi|_{k}(k)=\varphi(k)$ for $k\in K$, and
$\varphi^{-1}|_{H}(h)=\varphi^{-1}(h)$ for $h\in H$. We can then combine
these deductions to show $b=\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(g))$ which proves the claim.
\end{proof}

<<Sub-step 3: $g\in\varphi[\varphi^{-1}(H)]$>>=
proof
  H is Subgroup of G & g in H & g is Element of G by B1;
  then B4: psi.g = (psi|H).g by Th2

  B5: a is Element of K & K is Subgroup of G & a in K & phi is

Any $g\in\ker(\varphi|_{H})$ is defined to be $\varphi|_{H}(g)=1_{G_{2}}$.
But $\varphi|_{H}(g)=\varphi(g)$ by Theorem~\ref{thm:characteristic:preparatory:restrict-group-morphism-to-subgroups}. So we have
$\varphi(g)=1_{G_{2}}$, which implies $g\in\ker(\varphi)$ by Theorem~\mml[Th41]{group6}.\MizThm{GROUP\_6}{41}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:characteristic:automorphism:automorphism-which-leaves-subgroup-invariant-is-automorphism-of-subgroup}
  Let $H\subgroup G$ be any subgroup.
  If $\varphi\in\Aut(G)$ is an automorphism such that $\varphi(H)=H$ it
  leaves $H$ invariant, then its restriction to $H$ is an automorphism
  $\varphi|_{H}\in\Aut(H)$.
\end{theorem}

This result isn't surprising, but proving surjectivity was surprisingly
(and agonizingly) hard.

\begin{proof}[Proof outline]
  We have for any $\varphi\in\Aut(G)$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    \tag{$A_{1}$} \varphi|_{H}(H)=H
  \end{equation*}
  be a morphism $\varphi|_{H}\colon H\to H$ by Theorem~\mml[Th49]{group6}%
\MizThm{GROUP\_6}{49}. This is our first claim $C_{1}$.
  Our next claim $C_{2}$ is that $\varphi|_{H}$ is injective by Lemma~\ref{lemma:characteristic:automorphism:restrict-automorphism-gives-monomorphism}
  and hypothesis $A_{1}$.

  The nontrivial part of the proof is establishing $\varphi|_{H}$ is
  surjective. Once established, it follows $\varphi|_{H}$ is bijective
  and thus an automorphism.
\end{proof}

  C2: f|H is one-to-one by Lm3;

  f|H is onto Endomorphism of H
  <<Proof: $\varphi|_{H}$ is surjective>>
  then f|H is bijective Homomorphism of H,H by C2;
  then f|H is Automorphism of H;
  hence thesis;
end;
@ %def Th24

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch (Surjectivity)]
For reasons I do not adequately understand, I could not simply handle
[[f|H]] as a [[Homomorphism of H,H]] (despite having established this
fact).

I could not use any theorem concerning surjectivity of group morphisms,
so I just ``forgot'' it was a morphism, proved surjectivity, then
``remembered'' it was a group morphism after all.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm-remark}
I am starting to think that the claim [[f is onto]] is different than
[[f is onto Homomorphism of G1,G2]].
\end{thm-remark}

@ %def Th25

\begin{proof}[Proof step ($\varphi(x)\notin\varphi(H)$)]
Since $x\in G$ and $x\notin H$, it follows that $\varphi(x)\notin\varphi(H)$
thanks to Theorem~\ref{thm:characteristic:preparatory:x-notin-A-implies-fx-notin-fA}.
We also need an extra step since $\varphi$ is considered first as a
function on the underlying set $U(H)$ of $H$, then we need to remember
that this is the same as $\varphi$ applied to the subgroup $H$.
\end{proof}
<<$\varphi(x)\notin\varphi(H)$>>=
not (phi.x in phi .: H)
proof
  not (phi.x in (phi .: UH)) by A1, A3, Th7;
  hence not (phi.x in (phi .: H)) by GRSOLV_1:8;
end;
@

\begin{proof}[Proof step ($\varphi(x)\in G)$.]
We need to make explicit that $\varphi(x)$ is not just ``some object'',
but an element of the group $G$. This follows from the fact $\varphi(x)$
is in the range of $\varphi$ by definition of the range of a function
(i.e., \mml[def3]{funct1}\MizDef{FUNCT\_1}[03]{3}). Since $\varphi$ is
an automorphism, in particular surjective, it follows that the set
underlying $\varphi(G)$ is the set underlying $G$, i.e., $U(G)$.
Then $\varphi(x)\in G$.
\end{proof}

<<$\varphi(x)\in G$>>=
phi.x is Element of G
proof
  dom phi = UG & rng phi = UG by A1, FUNCT_2:def 1;

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:characteristic:automorphism:image-of-maximal-subgroup-under-automorphism-is-maximal}
  Let $G$ be a group, $\varphi\in\Aut(G)$ an arbitrary automorphism.
  If $H\properSubgroup G$ is a maximal subgroup, then
  $\varphi(H)\properSubgroup G$ is also maximal.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof outline]
  Since $H\properSubgroup G$ is maximal, if $\varphi(H)$ were not
  maximal, there would be a subgroup $K\properSubgroup G$ such that
  $\varphi(H)\properSubgroup K$. In that case, $\varphi^{-1}(K)=L$ would
  be a proper subgroup which contains $H$ as a proper subgroup, which is
  impossible. Thus $\varphi(H)$ must be maximal.

\begin{proof}[Sub-proof outline ($H$ is maximal implies $K=G$).]
Let $K$ be an arbitrary subgroup of $G$ such that $\varphi(H)\properSubgroup K$.
We can consider $\psi\in\Aut(G)$ defined by $\psi(x)=\varphi^{-1}(x)$
for all $x\in G$. Since $H\properSubgroup K\properSubgroup G$, we can
find some $k\in K$ but $k\notin K$. Then $\psi(k)\in\psi(K)$. Since $H$
is maximal, $\varphi(\psi(K))=G$. But also $\varphi(\psi(K))=K$. Hence $K=G$.
