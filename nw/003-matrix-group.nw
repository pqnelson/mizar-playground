\chapter{Matrix Groups}

We will begin formalizing the notion of ``matrix groups'' (a.k.a.,
linear groups) in Mizar. Most of the hard work has been done elsewhere,
so now it's just a matter of defining functors and proving they are, in
fact, groups.

For this article, we work with fields and vector spaces over fields. It
is entirely possible to define a matrix group over unital commutative
rings (like $\ZZ$), but this is more than what we need.

Just thinking ahead, I know that the theorem stating the determinant of
products is the product of determinants occurs in \mml{matrix11}, and
the Hermitian conjugate of a matrix is defined in
Definition~\mml[def2]{matrixc1} as ``\lstinline{@"}''. But the notion of
a unitary matrix is not defined (so far as I can tell). I would have to
define it --- something like
\begin{mizar}
definition
  let n be Nat;
  let IT be Matrix of n, F_Complex;
  attr IT is Unitary means
  IT is invertible & IT~ = IT @";
end;
\end{mizar}
