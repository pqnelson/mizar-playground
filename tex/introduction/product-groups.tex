\section{Product Groups}

This is formalized in~\mml{group7}. The basic idea is to have some
indexing set $I$, then consider a family of magmas indexed by it $F_{i}$
for $i\in I$. The Mizar notation for $F_{i}$ is ``\lstinline{F.i}''.
This leans on the notion of a product of a family of sets, as given in
Definition~\mml[def 5]{card3}:

\begin{mizar}
func product f -> set means :: CARD_3:def 5
:Def5: for x being object holds x in it iff
  ex g st x = g & dom g = dom f &
          for y being object st y in dom f
          holds g.y in f.y;
\end{mizar}

The basic ``design pattern'' surrounding product groups as implemented
in Mizar:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ``\lstinline{multMagma-yielding}'' for a relation means that each
  value in the range is a ``\lstinline{non empty multMagma}''
  (\mml[def1]{group7})
\item ``\lstinline{multMagma-Family of I}'' (where ``I'' is some indexing
  set) is just a ``\lstinline{multMagma-yielding ManySortedSet of I}''
  (\mml{group7})
\item ``\lstinline{ManySortedSet of I}'' is a
  ``\lstinline{total I-defined Function}'', i.e., it's a family of sets
  indexed by ``I'' (\mml[def1]{pboole})
\item If ``I'' is an indexing set and ``F'' is a
  ``\lstinline{multMagma-Family of I}'', then we can construct
  ``\lstinline{product F}'' (\mml[def2]{group7}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{mizar}
definition :: GROUP_7:def 2
  let I be set, F be multMagma-Family of I;
  func product F -> strict multMagma means
  :Def2:
  the carrier of it = product Carrier F &
  for f, g being Element of product Carrier F,
      i being set
  st i in I
  ex Fi being non empty multMagma,
     h being Function
  st Fi = F.i & h = (the multF of it).(f,g) &
     h.i = (the multF of Fi).(f.i,g.i);
  existence;
  uniqueness;
end;
\end{mizar}

We need to establish a ``\lstinline{multMagma-Family of I}'' is
``\lstinline{Group-like associative non empty}''. There is no notion of a
``\lstinline{Group-Family of I}'', though I think it might be worthwhile.

\begin{ddanger}
Product groups are under-developed in Mizar, in my opinion. The
universal property of products for groups is not established. Taking the
product of a finite set of groups is tedious and requires a lot more
work than it deserves. \emph{It would be very worth-while to write
quality-of-life results for product grups.} I'm not even sure how to
define the wreath product without a number of preliminary work done on
product groups. (I suspect this will be my second article to Mizar.)
