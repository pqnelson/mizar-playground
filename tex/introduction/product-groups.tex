\section{Product Groups}

This is formalized in~\mml{group7}. The basic idea is to have some
indexing set $I$, then consider a family of magmas indexed by it $F_{i}$
for $i\in I$. The Mizar notation for $F_{i}$ is ``\lstinline{F.i}''.
This leans on the notion of a product of a family of sets, as given in
Definition~\mml[def 5]{card3}:

\begin{mizar}
func product f -> set means :: CARD_3:def 5
:Def5: for x being object holds x in it iff
  ex g st x = g & dom g = dom f &
          for y being object st y in dom f
          holds g.y in f.y;
\end{mizar}
