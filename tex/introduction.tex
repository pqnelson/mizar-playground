\section{Group Action}

Mizar follows Bourbaki~\cite{bourbaki1974elements} in handling group
actions by means of groups with operators.

\begin{definition}[{\cite[I\S3.1 def 1]{bourbaki1974elements}}]
Let $\Omega$ be a set, $E$ another set. An \define{Action} of $\Omega$
on $E$ is a mapping $\Omega\to E^{E}$.
\end{definition}

This is a representation of $\Omega$, in modern terminology. Nowadays,
we think of an action as either a morphism $\lambda\colon\Omega\times T\to E$
or $\rho\colon E\times\Omega\to E$ (depending on if we want to act on
the left or right, respectively).

\begin{definition}[{\cite[I \S4.2 def 2]{bourbaki1974elements}, \mml{group9}}]
Let $\Omega$ be some set. A \define{Group with Operators in $\Omega$}
consists of a group $G$ equipped with an action of $\Omega$ on $G$ such
that the action distributes over $G$'s law of composition:
\begin{equation}
  \forall g_{1},g_{2}\in G,\forall\omega\in\Omega,
  (g_{1}\cdot g_{2})^{\omega} = {g_{1}}^{\omega}\cdot{g_{2}}^{\omega}.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{def-remark}
From a modern perspective, we have each $\omega\in\Omega$ give us a
group endomorphism $(-)^{\omega}\colon G\to G$. Then $\Omega$ is a
collection of endomorphisms. If we have some way to compose these
operators together in an associative way, then we've got a monoid
$\Omega$ acting on a group $G$.
\end{def-remark}

\begin{def-remark}
If we take $\Omega=\emptyset$, then the group with operators in
$\emptyset$ over $G$ coincides with just the group itself.
\end{def-remark}

\begin{def-remark}
It seems insane that the Jordan-H\"older theorem is given for groups
with operators, but not for groups, when the ``with operators'' are not
needed. I fear I will need to ``hack'' a way around this by noting for
any group $G$ there is a unique group with operators $\Omega=\emptyset$
and then adapt the results from \mml{group9} for groups as we know and
love them.
\end{def-remark}

\begin{theorem}[Schreier, {\mml[th116,117]{group9}}]
Given two composition series $\Sigma_{1}$ and $\Sigma_{2}$ for a group
with operatos $G$, there exists two composition series $\Sigma_{1}'$ and $\Sigma_{2}'$
such that $\Sigma_{1}'$ is finer than $\Sigma_{1}$, $\Sigma_{2}'$ is
finer than $\Sigma_{2}$, and $\Sigma_{1}'$ is equivalent to $\Sigma_{2}'$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{thm-remark}
This is Bourbaki's version of Schreier's theorem, found in \emph{Algebra}~\cite{bourbaki1974elements}
chapter I \S4{.}7, Theorem~5. Compare this to the version given in
Gorenstein~\cite{gorenstein1980finite} Theorem~1{.}2{.}7.
\end{thm-remark}
