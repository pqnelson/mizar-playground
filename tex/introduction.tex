\section{Group Action}

Mizar follows Bourbaki~\cite{bourbaki1974elements} in handling group
actions by means of groups with operators.

\begin{definition}[{\cite[I\S3.1 def 1]{bourbaki1974elements}}]
Let $\Omega$ be a set, $E$ another set. An \define{Action} of $\Omega$
on $E$ is a mapping $\Omega\to E^{E}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{def-remark}
This is a representation of $\Omega$, in modern terminology. Nowadays,
we think of an action as either a morphism $\lambda\colon\Omega\times T\to E$
or $\rho\colon E\times\Omega\to E$ (depending on if we want to act on
the left or right, respectively).
\end{def-remark}

\begin{def-remark}
A good deal of group action has been formalized in~\mml{group10}, the
first 9 theorems and 17 definitions are dedicated entirely to group
action on a nonempty set. (There are 17 theorems and 21 definitions in
that article, so more than half the results are about group actions, and
three quarters of the definitions formalize related notions.)
\end{def-remark}

\section{Group with Operators}

When presented in full generality, this concepts seems like a useless
abstraction. But it may be useful to think of $A\subset\Aut(G)$, and
working with a group $G$ equipped with a group action $\pi\colon A\to\Aut(G)$.
Then formalization of normal series has some slick tricks.

\begin{definition}[{\cite[I \S4.2 def 2]{bourbaki1974elements}, \mml{group9}}]
Let $\Omega$ be some set. A \define{Group with Operators in $\Omega$}
consists of a group $G$ equipped with an action of $\Omega$ on $G$ such
that the action distributes over $G$'s law of composition:
\begin{equation}
  \forall g_{1},g_{2}\in G,\forall\omega\in\Omega,
  (g_{1}\cdot g_{2})^{\omega} = {g_{1}}^{\omega}\cdot{g_{2}}^{\omega}.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{def-remark}
From a modern perspective, we have each $\omega\in\Omega$ give us a
group endomorphism $(-)^{\omega}\colon G\to G$. Then $\Omega$ is a
collection of endomorphisms. If we have some way to compose these
operators together in an associative way, then we've got a monoid
$\Omega$ acting on a group $G$.

Actually, if you look at, e.g., Aschbacher's \emph{Finite Group Theory}~\cite{aschbacher2000finite},
he doesn't talk about a group with operators in $\Omega$, but just jumps
to a group $G$ with a group $A$ acting on it (by means of a
representation $A\to\Aut(G)$). 
\end{def-remark}

\begin{def-remark}
If we take $\Omega=\emptyset$, then the group with operators in
$\emptyset$ over $G$ coincides with just the group itself.
\end{def-remark}

\begin{def-remark}
It seems insane that the Jordan--H\"older theorem is given for groups
with operators, but not for groups, when the ``with operators'' are not
needed. I fear I will need to ``hack'' a way around this by noting for
any group $G$ there is a unique group with operators $\Omega=\emptyset$
and then adapt the results from \mml{group9} for groups as we know and
love them.

(Actually, groups with operators were used early on --- even in the '80s
--- specifically because there is a slick proof of the Jordan--H\"older
theorem using them.)
\end{def-remark}

\begin{theorem}[Schreier, {\mml[th116,117]{group9}}]\index{Schreier!Theorem}
Given two composition series $\Sigma_{1}$ and $\Sigma_{2}$ for a group
with operatos $G$, there exists two composition series $\Sigma_{1}'$ and $\Sigma_{2}'$
such that $\Sigma_{1}'$ is finer than $\Sigma_{1}$, $\Sigma_{2}'$ is
finer than $\Sigma_{2}$, and $\Sigma_{1}'$ is equivalent to $\Sigma_{2}'$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{thm-remark}
This is Bourbaki's version of Schreier's theorem, found in \emph{Algebra}~\cite{bourbaki1974elements}
chapter I \S4{.}7, Theorem~5. Compare this to the version given in
Gorenstein~\cite{gorenstein1980finite} Theorem~1{.}2{.}7.
