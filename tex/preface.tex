This is an attempt to learn Mizar while formalizing some results in
finite group theory. I am assuming familiarity with group theory, the
reader has at least an undergraduate understanding of mathematics.
Results are reviewed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:pure-math}.

\subsection*{Goal: Quasithin Groups}
One of the driving questions is how feasible is it to formalize the
classification theorem of quasithin groups? Aschbacher and Smith have
written a self-contained 1220-page
proof~\cite{aschbacher2004classification1,aschbacher2004classification2}.

This constitutes about a quarter of the classification theorem for
finite simple groups, the theorem with the world's longest proof. The
classification of quasithin groups constitutes a ``proof of concept''
whether formalizing the entire classification theorem is feasible ``by hand''.

\bigbreak
Can Mizar formalize the mathematics surrounding the classification of
quasithin groups?

The answer appears to be, ``If so, not at present.'' Mizar is lacking
some infrastructure. This document is an attempt to formalize
\emph{some} of that infrastructure, capture some of the thought process
behind formalizing the mathematics, and provide some insight into how
the mathematics works.

\bigbreak
As far as the classification of finite simple groups, there are two
proofs of it: the first generation proof spans approximately {15,000}
pages across decades of articles in many technical journals; the second
generation attempts to collate this in about a dozen books (volume 40 in
AMS's series ``Mathematical Surveys and Monographs''). Thus far, the
nine books of the second generation proof span 3994 pages; four more
books are likely to be published\footnote{According to Ron Solomon's
personal communication to Hugo de Garis, as reported on MathOverflow \url{https://mathoverflow.net/a/217397/22457}}, resulting in approximately 3041
pages\footnote{This is based on using a simple linear regression on the
number of pages in volume $X$ more than in volume one, against the
volume number. The adjusted $R^{2}$ for this model is $0.8806$, so it's
not terrible.}. The approximately 7035 page proof is a ``bridge too
far'', the quasithin classification is one-sixth this size: still big,
but at least plausibly formalizable.

% 137 + 200 + 400 + 331 + 471 + 518 + 340 + 483 + 514
% = 2880 + 514 = 3394
% vol 1 = 139 - 2
% vol 2 = 215 - 15
% vol 3 = 419 - 19
% vol 4 = 349 - 18
% vol 5 = 475 - 14
% vol 6 = 532 - 14
% vol 7 = 352 - 12
% vol 8 = 483
% vol 9 = 530 - 16

\subsection*{On Style}
The writing style is particularly idiosyncratic. Although Mizar is
designed in a declarative proof style, and highly readable, it is
difficult (for me) to keep track of what I've done and where I'm going.

Literate programming techniques are used to organize and present the
proof scripts and definitions. Cross-referencing occurs automatically,
so we can see where definitions and theorems are used (for the reader's
convenience). For me, as author, literate programming let's me track
intent and keep goals in mind.

The pure mathematician can read these notes like it's written in the
style of the great Arthur Besse\index{Besse, Arthur L.}. Or this document may be read, like
Edward Gibbon's\index{Gibbon, Edward}
\emph{Decline and Fall}, as written by two Alex Nelsons: one directing
his voice in code towards Mizar (formatted in \verb#teletype font#), the
other in \emph{sotto voce} towards the reader through ``footnotes'' (the
annotations in English which constitute roughly two-thirds of the text).

\subsection*{On Mizar}
Mizar is a proof assistant working in set theoretic foundations. It is
among the most sophisticated theorem provers around. Mizar's language is
human readable and resembles ``ordinary mathematics''. Unfortunately, it
lacks documentation in one central location. The best introductions on
the subject remain~\cite{grabowski2010mizar} and~\cite{wiedijk2006mizman}.

I don't think its sophistication is adequately appreciated or understood
by its competitors. Wiedijk attempts to model its type
system~\cite{wiedijk2007mizar}, but type theoretic wags just sneer,
``Why not use a \emph{real} type system?'' Those wags have now probably been eaten
by bears, like the children who made mock of the prophet Elisha. But if
they have somehow survived, they may wish to confer de Bruijn's mathematical
vernacular (see section {3.6} of~\cite{de1994mathematical}) where soft
typing (what de Bruijn calls ``higher typing'') is first introduced in
formalizing mathematical texts. Soft type systems are characteristic of
serious attempts at formalizing mathematics \emph{in any foundation or framework.}

Josef Urban~\cite{urban2003translating} summarizes the constructor
system and its translation to ``vanilla'' first-order logic. What's a
``constructor'' in Mizar? Well, as Trybulec~\cite{trybulec1993some}
explains: a \emph{predicate} is a ``constructor'' of (atomic) formulas,
a \emph{mode} is a constructor of (atomic) types, a \emph{functor} is a
constructor of (atomic) terms. These are the constructors we will
encounter.

\bigbreak
For convenience, I have collected an index for occurrances of Mizar code
(in ``Mizar References''). Any defined term which appears in this text
should appear there, as well as any definitions or theorems referenced
from the Mizar library.

%% \M There are a few drawbacks to Mizar's sophisticated system. For

%% Another problem is that there are various synonyms which confuse

%% ``\verb#Nat#'' is defined in \verb#ORDINAL1# as
%% ``\verb#natural number#'' (where ``\verb#natural#'' is an adjective
%% specifying $\mathtt{it}\in\omega$ and ``\verb#number#'' is a synonym for
%% ``\verb#set#''). The other number systems have a similar ``two pronged''
%% definition strategy.
