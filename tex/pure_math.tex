\chapter{Pure Math}\label{chapter:pure-math}

This is just a grab bag of random results from the literature. A good
introduction to finite group theory would be I.~Martin
Isaacs~\cite{isaacs2008finite} for readers who have taken introductory
abstract algebra, Aschbacher~\cite{aschbacher2000finite} for a summary
of the tools necessary for proving the classification of quasithin groups~\cite{aschbacher2004classification1,aschbacher2004classification2}.
For a summary of finite simple groups with pointers to the literature,
Wilson~\cite{wilson2009finite} does a great job.


\begin{notation}
Most notation is following the literature, but just to
review them here:
\begin{itemize}%\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item The trivial group is denoted $\trivialGroup$.
\item If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, we write $H\subgroup G$; and if
  further $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$, we write $H\properSubgroup G$.
\item For any group $G$, its proper trivial group is denoted
  $\trivialSubgroup_{G}\subgroup G$ or (if there is no confusion) just
  $\trivialSubgroup$.
\item Normal subgroups are denoted by $N\normalSubgroup G$ and proper
  normal subgroups are $N\properNormalSubgroup G$.
\item If $g$, $h\in G$ are group elements, we denote the conjugate of $g$ by
$h$ as $g^{h}=h^{-1}gh$.
\item Like any self-respecting American, I do not consider zero to be a
natural number. Thus $\NN=\{1,2,3,\dots\}$. When I need to refer to the
non-negative integers, I write $\NN_{0}=\{0\}\cup\NN$.
\item The other number systems are with the usual notation ($\ZZ$ for
  integers, $\QQ$ for rationals, $\RR$ for reals, $\CC$ for complex numbers).
\end{itemize}
\end{notation}

\begin{theorem}[{\mml[Th41]{group6}}]\MizThm{GROUP\_6}{41}
  Let $\varphi\colon G_{1}\to G_{2}$ is a group morphism, and
  $e_{G_{2}}\in G_{2}$ be the identity element.
  Then $g\in\ker(h)$ iff $\varphi(g)=e_{G_{2}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[{\mml[Th56]{group6}}]\MizThm{GROUP\_6}{56}
  Let $\varphi\colon G_{1}\to G_{2}$ is a group morphism.
  Then $\varphi$ is injective if and only if $\ker(\varphi)=\trivialSubgroup$.
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:pure-math:iso-subgroups-have-same-order}
  Let $\varphi\in\Aut(G)$ be any automorphism of a group $G$.
  If $H\subgroup G$ is a subgroup, then the order of $H$ and
  $\varphi(H)$ are the same.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
This follows from $\varphi$ being a bijection.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm-remark}
Mizar as a stronger result, since
\cite[Th73]{group6}\MizTh{GROUP\_6}{73} proves isomorphic groups have the same order.
\end{thm-remark}

\begin{theorem}[{Gorenstein~\cite[{Th.2.1.5}]{gorenstein1980finite}}]
  If $H$ is a minimal normal subgroup of $G$ (i.e., $H\normalSubgroup G$
  and there is no nontrivial proper subgroup of $H$ which is normal in
  $G$),
  then \emph{either} $H$ is an elementary Abelian $p$-group (for some
  prime $p\in\NN$) \emph{or} $H$ is the direct product of isomorphic
  non-Abelian simple groups.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}
The class formula\index{Class Formula} for groups is proven in~\mml{weddwitt}.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
Let $\pi$ be a set of prime numbers. We call a group $G$ a
\define{$\pi$-Group} if the set of the prime divisors of the order of
$G$, denoted $\pi(G)$, is a subset of $\pi\supset\pi(G)$.
\end{definition}

Observe that if $\pi=\{p\}$ is a single prime number, then we recover
the notion of a $p$-group.
