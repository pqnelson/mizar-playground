\section{Local Analysis of Finite Groups}

``Local analysis of a finite group $G$ means the study of the structure
of, and the interaction betewen, the centralizers and normalizers of
nonidentity $p$-subgroups of $G$.'' Bender and Glauberman note in the
preface to their book, \emph{Local Analysis for the Odd Order Theorem}.
This is carefully introduced in I.~Martin Isaacs' \emph{Finite Group Theory},
chapter 2C (pp.58 \emph{et seq}.).
