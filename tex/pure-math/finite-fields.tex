\section{Finite Fields}

It seems that Galois Fields\index{Field!Galois} are not defined in
general, not anywhere I could find. Well, true to form, Mizar defines
the finite rings $\ZZ/n\ZZ$ as \lstinline{INT.Ring(n)}. And as far as
Mizar cares, a field is just a ring satisfying extra properties. So the
finite ring \lstinline{INT.Ring(p)} is provably a field, for example.

Unfolding the definitions, we have Definition~\mml[def10,11,12]{vectsp1}
first define \lstinline{Skew-Field} as a ring satisfying extra properties
(i.e., \lstinline{non degenerated} \lstinline{almost_left_invertible} \lstinline{Ring}).
Then a \lstinline{Field} is \lstinline{commutative Skew-Field}.

\begin{example}[{$\FF_{3}$}]
The field with three elements $\FF_{3}$ is defined as \lstinline!Z_3!
in \mml[def 20]{mod2}\MizDef{MOD\_2}{20}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[{$\ZZ/n\ZZ$}]
The integers modulo $n$ form a ring in Definition~\mml[def12]{int3} as
\lstinline{INT.Ring(n)}. I think Theorem~\mml[Th12]{int3} suffices to
prove \lstinline{INT.Ring(p)} is a field. Also Registration~\mml[reg14]{int3}
associated \lstinline{INT.Ring(p)} with being\dots well, many things,
but they combine together to make it a finite field.
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
Prove \lstinline{INT.Ring(p |^ n)} is a field where ``\lstinline{p |^ n}''
is Mizar for $p^{n}$ (where $p,n\in\NN$ and $p$ is prime).
\end{exercise}
