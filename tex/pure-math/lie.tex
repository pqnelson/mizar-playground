\section{Finite Groups of Lie Type}

\begin{ddanger}
The notation for finite groups of Lie type is bewildering to people who
know Lie groups. This is because Artin~\cite{artin1955order} introduced
idiosyncratic notation for finite groups of Lie type, which diverges
quite badly from the notational choices made in the development of Lie
groups.
