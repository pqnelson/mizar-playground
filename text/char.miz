          assume y in rng F2;
          then y in A by D1;
          hence y in the carrier of G;
        end;
        hence rng F2 c= the carrier of G by TARSKI:def 3;
        thus rng F2 c= A by D2;
      end;
      then reconsider F2 as FinSequence of the carrier of G;
      set h2 = Product(F2 |^ I);
      C9: (for k being Nat st k in dom F1
      holds F2.k = phi.(F1.k)) & len F1 = len I & len F2 = len I
      proof
        thus (for k being Nat st k in dom F1
        holds F2.k = phi.(F1.k))
        proof
          let k be Nat;
          assume D1: k in dom F1;
          then k in dom F2 by C7;
          then F2.k = F(k) by C6
                   .= phi.(F1/.k);
          hence F2.k = phi.(F1.k) by D1,PARTFUN1:def 6;
        end;
        thus len F1 = len I by C2;
        thus len F2 = len I by C2,C5;
      end;
      then phi.(Product(F1 |^ I)) = Product(F2 |^ I) by GROUP_9:125;
      then len F2 = len I & rng F2 c= A & Product(F2 |^ I) = phi.h
      by C4,C9,C8;
      hence phi.h in H by GROUP_4:28;
    end;
    for h being Element of H
    holds phi.h in H
    proof
      let h be Element of H;
      C1: h in H;
      h is Element of G by GROUP_2:42;
      then phi.h in H by B2,C1;
      hence thesis;
    end;
    hence Image(phi|H) is Subgroup of H by Th47;
  end;
  thus gr A is characteristic by A3,Th42;
end;

theorem Th49:
  G` is characteristic
proof
  [.1_G,1_G.] in commutators G;
  then A1: commutators G <> {};
  for phi being Automorphism of G holds phi .: commutators G =
  commutators G by Th46;
  then gr commutators G is characteristic by A1,Th48;
  hence thesis;
end;
